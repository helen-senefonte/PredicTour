# PredicTour

### PredicTour is an approach to process check-ins of LBSN users and predict mobility patterns of a tourist visiting new locations even without previous visiting records.  The proposal is composed of three blocks:  mobility modeling,  profile clustering, and tourist mobility prediction. In the first block, sequences of LBSN posts within a time interval associated with additional information as users' classification (returner or explorer), origin, and destination,  provide data for a new structure ``mobility descriptor''.  In the profile clustering, Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) and  Fuzzy C-means (FCM) work jointly to group users according to mobility descriptors.  In the last block, PredicTour identifies a tourist's profile and estimates the mobility patterns when the tourist visits new places with or without previous information. 

### All codes are going to be available soon.
